KELTNER CHANNEL
The Keltner Channel is a technical indicator that is often used by traders to identify volatility and the direction of the market.
The Keltner Channel is composed of three components: The upper band, the lower band, and the middle line where :

Middle Line = 20-period exponential moving average of the closing price
Upper Band = Middle line + Multiplier * 10-period ATR
List item = Middle line - Multiplier * 10-period ATR
The two indicators - Keltner Channel and Bollinger Bands are quite similar. Keltner Channels use ATR to calculate the upper and lower bands while Bollinger Bands use standard deviation instead.
The interpretation of the indicators is similar, although since the calculations are different the two indicators may provide slightly different information or trade signals.
While Keltner Channels can help identify trend direction, and even provide some trade signals, they are best used in conjunction with price action analysis, fundamentals if trading for the long term, and other technical indicators.
