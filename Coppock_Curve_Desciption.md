# Coppock Curve
The Coppock Curve is a long-term price momentum indicator used primarily to recognize major downturns and upturns in a stock market index. 
A reading above zero on the indicator signals a buy, while a drop below zero is a sell signal.
All the calculations have been clearly documented in the code. 
Like any other oscillator, the Coppock Curve indicator can be used to find divergences – discrepancies in price and indicator readings. 
If the price reaches a new peak or trough, but the indicator does not reach the corresponding extremes, it diverges.
Such a signal means that the current trend may be slowing, andwe could wait for either a trend change, or a deep correction, or a price transition to the side. Even though the Coppock Curve indicator is not widely used among traders, it can be a useful trading tool for detecting price fluctuations. The indicator does not redraw its values, which is a good advantage.
Due to its settings, the indicator can be used both in the trending market and during consolidation periods.
